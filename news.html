            <h4> Economists propose algorithm for flexible management of innovative enterprise for sustainable development</h4>
        <p>
        Economists from RUDN University have created a methodology based on mathematical modeling to manage production effectively with rapidly emerging innovations. The <a href ="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/17/12682"> results</a>  were published in Sustainability.

            <h4> Students understand calculus better when the lessons are active</h4>
        <p>
            College students learn more calculus in an active learning course in which students solve problems during class than in a traditional lecture-based course. That's according to a peer-reviewed study my colleagues and I published in Science. We also found that college students better understood complex calculus concepts and earned better grades in the active learning course.        </p>

            <h4> Flipped coins found not to be as fair as thought </h4>
        <p>
            A large team of researchers affiliated with multiple institutions across Europe, has found evidence backing up work by Persi Diaconis in 2007 in which he suggested tossed coins are more likely to land on the same side they started on, rather than on the reverse. The team conducted experiments designed to test the randomness of coin flipping and posted their results on the arXiv preprint server.  </p>
