                            College students learn more calculus in an active learning course in which students solve
                            problems during class than in a traditional lecture-based course. That's according to a
                            peer-reviewed study published in <a href="https://theconversation.com/europe">The Conversation</a>. We also found that college
                            students better understood complex calculus concepts and earned better grades in the active

                        <p>
                            A large team of researchers affiliated with multiple institutions across Europe, has found
                            evidence backing up work by Persi Diaconis in 2007 in which he suggested tossed coins are
                            more likely to land on the same side they started on, rather than on the reverse. The team
                            conducted experiments designed to test the randomness of coin flipping and posted their
                            results on the arXiv preprint server. </p>

Participants completed online sessions where they learned new complex multiplication problems or were tested on previously learned material. Participants had better recall in the sleep learning condition than in the wake learning condition. Even when participants had varying learning abilities, the sleep learning condition showed a beneficial effect on recall, with a smaller effect size.

                        <h4> Machine learning unravels mysteries of atomic geometry</h4>
                        <p>
                            New research has used machine learning to find the properties of atomic pieces of geometry, in pioneering work that could drive the development of new results in mathematics.


Mathematicians from the University of Nottingham and Imperial College London have, for the first time, used machine learning to expand and accelerate work identifying "atomic shapes" that form the basic pieces of geometry in higher dimensions. Their findings have been published in <a href ="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/">Nature Communications. </a></p>

                        <h4>Alan Turing and the Power of Negative Thinking
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Mathematical proofs based on a technique called diagonalization can be relentlessly contrarian, but they help reveal the limits of algorithms.Algorithms have become ubiquitous. They optimize our commutes, process payments, and coordinate the flow of internet traffic. It seems that for every problem that can be articulated in precise mathematical terms, there’s an algorithm that can solve it, at least in principle.

                            But that's not the case—some seemingly simple problems can never be solved algorithmically. The pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing proved the existence of such “uncomputable” problems nearly a century ago, in the same paper where he formulated <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/alan-turings-most-important-machine-was-never-built-20230503/"> mathematical model of computation</a> that launched modern computer science.</p>
